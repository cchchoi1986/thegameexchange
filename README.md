# TheGameExchange

## Introduction

This project is created to match users with second hand games.  It will allow users to follow each other, comment on their walls, trade games with one another.  It also allows browsing of multiple versions of each, and show what is the latest trends in second hand gaming popularity.

I'm using these tools:

* Ruby on Rails
* Devise Gem
* Nokogiri
* Bootstrap
* Play-Asia API
* AJAX
* JQuery
